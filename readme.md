This is my GitHub home page for learning to write better codes in [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) (Hypertext Markup Language), [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3) (Cascading Style Sheets) and JS [ES5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#5th_Edition) (JavaScript). Projects here are divided into individual folders. Each project folder contains numerous html/css/js files related to that project.

> The project folder is named with a six digits YearMonthDay the project was created (example [170609](https://github.com/eldus/eldus.github.io/tree/master/170909)). To spin-off another similar related topic by creating sub folder inside and with a running single alphanumeric name [170609/1](https://github.com/eldus/eldus.github.io/tree/master/170609/1), 170609/2, etc.

#### Project Folders:
* 701 Local Storage and PouchDB
* 702 JSON
* 703 VueJS2.3
* 704 AngularJS1.6
* 705 React
* 706 Google Signin
* 708 PHP JSON
* 708 Etc

#### My Learning Strategy here:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript
* PHP 7
* JSON (replace XML)
* SQL (MySQL)
* Python

#### Getting Started:
A GitHub account for storing and rendering static HTML, CSS and JS codes. Download and install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on the personal computer. It provides an organised way to synchronize folders and files between the computer and the remote GitHub host. A simple text editor like [ATOM](https://atom.io), [Brackets](https://brackets.io), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to create and edit text files on the computer. Use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen/), a playground for the front end side of the web, to write and test HTML/CSS/JS Sniplets.

#### Use GitHub Pages to "Demo" HTML/CSS/JS codes:
* On the project root: https://eldus.github.io
* Or on https://io.github.eldus.com (remote backup)

> GitHub Pages is designed to host project pages directly from a GitHub repository. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesn't support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python. **Other Limitations:** Github Pages does not permits data to be written back to the host by the javascripts.
